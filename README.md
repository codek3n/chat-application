# Chat App Documentation

This documentation provides instructions on how to run the express server, client, and socket server for the chat app.

## Server

To run the server:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the server folder:


### `cd server`

3. Run the server using nodemon:

### `nodemon`


The server will now start running with automatic restarts whenever changes are made to the server code.

## Vite Client

To run the Vite client:

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the client folder:

### `cd client`

3. Start the Vite development server:

### `npm run dev`


The Vite client development server will now start.

## Socket Server

To run the socket server:

1. Open another terminal or command prompt.
2. Change the directory to the socket server folder:

### `cd socket`

3. Run the socket server using nodemon:

### `nodemon`


The socket server will now start running with automatic restarts whenever changes are made to the server code.

That's it! You have successfully set up and run the chat app web application. The express server, Vite client, and socket server are all running. You can access the chat app by opening a web browser and visiting the appropriate URL for the client, depending on the port and hostname where it is running.
